# Your mixed reality home

## What is the mixed reality home?

Windows Mixed Reality is the first spatial operating system. Instead of using a flat screen and a 2D interface, it leverages our instinctual ability to navigate space. Every place has a purpose and content has context. Just like how your PC starts at the desktop interface and your phone begins with a start screen, Windows Mixed Reality starts at the mixed reality home. It's an environment that you can navigate through and personalize to make your own. It's the canvas for the thousands of apps available in the Microsoft Store. You can multitask with these apps like you've never been able to before--in 3D where space almost limitless. For more details, also see Navigating the Windows Mixed Reality home.

### How do I move through the mixed reality home?
* **Physically walking:** If you have setup your headset with a room boundary and have cleared available space to safely walk around, you can take physical steps to move short distances in your home. One step in the real world is approximately a step in the virtual experience.
* **Teleporting (using motion controllers):** You can quickly jump to a location by teleporting. Using the motion controllers, you can teleport by pushing the right or left thumbstick forward, aiming towards the direction you want to go, and then releasing the thumbstick.
* **Teleporting (using gamepad):** Using a gamepad, you can teleport by pushing the left thumbstick forward.
* **Teleporting (using mouse):** Using a mouse, hold down the right-click mouse button and release at your desired location.

You can modify the direction you teleport in for all the above inputs by rotating the thumbstick (for the motion controllers and gamepad) or by using the scroll wheel on the mouse.

A handy feature is called "Snap to App" that lets you jump to the ideal position to interact with app windows. Simply point you teleportation arc to a window and let go. The system will automatically place you in the ideal location to enjoy the content of that targeted window.
* **Virtually walking:** You can virtually move continuously by pressing down on the thumbstick on your motion controllers or gamepad and then moving in the desired direction.

### How do I launch an app?

From your mixed reality home, press the Windows button to launch the Start menu. Click on the app you wish to launch. Now, place the app where you would like to use it.

### What is the New for You app?

You may notice that there is a Windows Store bag in your mixed reality home. Clicking it will show you exciting apps that you can download.

### How do I personalize my home?

You can decorate your home with apps and holograms. Apps can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store. You can also use the Holograms app to place objects in your home.

You can adjust the location and size of things in your home by using the Adjust button. You can also use two motion controllers to quickly move and resize items by pointing to any part of a hologram or the holobar of a window with both controllers and then moving them closer or farther apart.
