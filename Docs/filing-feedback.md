# Filing feedback

## Why it's important

The engineering team internally uses the same mechanism for finding and filing bugs. So use Feedback Hub and file issues; we are listening!

## How To file Feedback for Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset on PC
* Ensure you have the immersive headset connected to your PC.![Feedback Tab](images/feedback1.png)
* Launch **Feedback Hub** on desktop with the HMD connected.![Add new feedback](images/feedback2.png)
* Go to **Feedback Tab** on the left pane. ![Details and repro steps](images/feedback3.png)
* Click **Add new feedback** button to enter the feedback.![Start Capture](images/feedback4.png)
* Select **Problem** in **What kind of feedback is this?** to make the feedback actionable.![Submit](images/feedback5.png)
* Provide meaningful feedback title in **Summarize your issue** box.![Thank You](images/feedback6.png)
* Provide details and steps to reproduce the issue in the **Give us more detail** box.
* Select **Mixed Reality** as the top category and then pick an applicable sub category:

| Subcategory      | Description                                                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apps             | Issues with a specific application.                                                   |
| Developer        | Issues in authoring / running an app for Mixed Reality.                               |
| Device           | Issues with the HMD itself.                                                           |
| Home experience  | Issues with your VR environment: interactions with the Windows Mixed Reality Home.    |
| Input            | Issues with input methods: motion controllers, speech, gamepad, or mouse and keyboard.|
| Set up           | Anything that is preventing you from setting up the device.                           |
| All other issues | Anything else.                                                                        |


* To help us identify and fix the bug faster, capturing traces and video is extremely helpful. To start collecting traces, click on **Start capture**. This will begin collecting traces and a video capture of your mixed reality scenario.
* Leave the Feedback app and run through the broken scenario. Do not close the Feedback Hub app at this point.
* After you are done with your scenario, go back to the feedback app and click **Stop Capture**. Once you do that, you should see that a file containing the traces has been added.
* Click **Submit**.
* This will lead you to Thank You page.
* At this point, your feedback has been successfully submitted.
* After you submit feedback, to easily direct other people (e.g. co-workers, Microsoft staff, [forum](https://forums.hololens.com/) readers et al) to the issue go to Feedback > My Feedback, click on the issue, and use the **Share** icon to get a shortened URL you can give to others to upvote, or escalate.

*Note: Before filing a bug, please ensure you meet the following constraints so that the logs are successfully uploaded with the feedback.*
* *Have a minimum of 3GB free disk space available on the main drive of the device.*
* *Ensure that a non-metered network is available in order to upload cabs.*
